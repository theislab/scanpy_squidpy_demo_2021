# scanpy squidpy demo 2021

Welcome to the scanpy and squidpy demo session in July 2021. This repository contains all necessary information for the hands-on practices to start with scanpy and squidpy.

## Prerequisites

All demo session notebooks are designed to work out of the box in Google Colabs. However, to explore the full functionality of both scanpy and squidpy, we recommend to install both tools locally.
